# advent-of-code-2017

My solutions for the [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2017)

This year I'm attempting them in Kotlin. I'd like to think I'd get further however I'm time poor.

## Days Completed so far
* Day 1 Just getting my feet wet, so far so good. Learned about Kotlin objects
* Day 2 First extension method, found out about `toTypedArray`. Cheeky bit of recursion  
* Day 3 Wow! great puzzle. 1st part done. Kotlin generators are great. Part2 : FML
* Day 4 Looking for a scan function but none found. Nice little extension for whitespace
* Day 5 Done. More tailrec. Used `.drop(n)` function on sequence. Nice
* Day 6 ... 
* Day 7 Trees! Destructed mulitple groups from a regex. Lovely
* Day 8
* Day 9 Nothing new here
* Day 10 Default params, `by lazy`, slices and nicely reused the circular index. Wow part 2, difficult to read
* Day 11 Hex coords
* Day 12 Dijkstra's shortest path! Some nie type aliasing, elvis operator and even a spread operator. A total dogs dinner of an implmentation of the algorithm 
 though. Very imperative.
