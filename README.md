# advent-of-code-2017

My solutions for the [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2017)

This year I'm attempting them in Kotlin. I'd like to think I'd get further however I'm time poor.

## Days Completed so far
* Day 1 Just getting my feet wet, so far so good. Learned about Kotlin objects
* Day 2 First extension method, found out about `toTypedArray`. Cheeky bit of recursion  
* Day 3 Wow! great puzzle. 1st part done. Kotling generators are great
* Day 4 Looking for a scan function but none found
